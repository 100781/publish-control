# PublishControl
_Publishing Confirmation Dialog for WordPress._

## Accidentally published post?
Nope, not here.
We've all been there before.

A new piece of content has been added to WordPress and you're making a couple of edits. OH SNAP! You just clicked "Publish" instead of "Save Draft."

You begin to sweat. That SEO plugin just pinged Google with the URL of the page, and it isn't ready for the world to see just yet. Mom's spaghetti is everywhere.

Publish Control provides you with a confirmation dialog when creating new posts in WordPress to avoid situations like this.

It's simple, reliable, and it just might make your day a bit better.
